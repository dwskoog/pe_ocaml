(* PROBLEM --
 * f p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
 * {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
 *
 * {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
 *
 * For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
 *
 * SOLUTION --
 * go go pythagorean triples.
